# Image Processing - Image Filters

## Overview
This project is a C++ command-line application designed for applying various graphical filters and transformations to images. It supports loading, manipulating, and saving images in multiple popular formats. 

## Technologies Used
* **C++**: The core language used for all image processing logic.
* **stb_image.h & stb_image_write.h**: Lightweight single-file header libraries used to handle decoding (loading) and encoding (saving) of image files without depending on heavy external libraries.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Design
The project leverages the principles of Object-Oriented Programming to encapsulate image data and operations. 
* **Encapsulation & Data Hiding**: The `Image` class isolates the actual raw image buffer (`imageData`), width, height, and color channels, preventing arbitrary and unsafe manipulation of memory outside of defined methods. 
* **Resource Management**: Uses RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), intelligently managing dynamic memory via constructors and a destructor which automatically frees the `imageData` using `stbi_image_free` when an `Image` object goes out of scope.
* **Overloaded Operators & Rule-of-Three**: Includes a custom copy constructor and assignment operator (`operator=`) to guarantee safe deep copying of the dynamically allocated image buffers, allowing intuitive usage like `image1 = image2`. The function call operator `operator()` is also overloaded for easy and semantic access/modification of pixel channels: `image(x, y, channel)`.
* **Exception Handling**: Validations such as checking image boundaries during pixel access or confirming allowed filename extensions throw exceptions (e.g., `std::invalid_argument`, `std::out_of_range`) to handle errors gracefully.

## Features & Supported Filters
The application features an interactive menu that lets users apply the following modifications to an image:
1.  **Invert Filter**: Produces a negative effect by inverting the color channels.
2.  **Rotate Filter**: Rotates the image by 90, 180, or 270 degrees.
3.  **Grayscale**: Converts a color image into shades of grey.
4.  **Darken / Lighten**: Adjusts the brightness of the image (0.5x for darken, 1.5x for lighten).
5.  **Black and White**: Reduces the image to pure black and white (no grey) based on a threshold.
6.  **Flip Image**: Mirrors the original image either horizontally or vertically.
7.  **Add Frame**: Adds a decorative border (either a solid blue simple frame or a red & white fancy striped frame).
8.  **Crop Image**: Slices the image to keep a specific rectangular segment.
9.  **Blur Filter**: Softens the image by averaging neighboring pixels, tunable across three intensity levels (low, medium, high).
10. **Merge Images**: Combines two images by taking the average of their pixel values. Matches dimensions by resizing or taking the common overlap.
11. **Detect Edges**: Highlights sharp color changes between neighboring pixels to trace figure outlines.
12. **Sunlight**: Imbues the image with a bright, warm yellowish tone.
13. **Resize**: Rescales the image dimensions by a given ratio or to absolute custom width/height values.
14. **Infrared Filter**: Simulates infrared photography by significantly boosting the red channel while inverting greens and blues.
15. **Purple Filter**: Adjusts color blends to give the image a distinct purple hue.
16. **Horizontal Shearing**: Skews the image horizontally.

## How to Compile & Run
Simply compile the main `.cpp` file. Ensure that `stb_image.h` and `stb_image_write.h` and `Image_Class.h` are located in the include directory for successful compilation.

```bash
g++ CS213_A1_Part2_22_20240658_20240200_20240241.cpp -o image_processor
./image_processor
```
